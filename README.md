## Description

Widgetized themes often include support for adding a featured page or post, but often there's no easy way to feature a category from your blog.

With Featured Category Widget you can easily featured a blog category (or a category from a custom taxonomy, like products), add a custom image and optionally show the category description and a list of sub categories.
