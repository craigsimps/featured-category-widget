Showcase a specific category with ease, including setting a featured image and listing child categories.

== Description ==

Widgetized themes often include support for adding a featured page or post, but often there's no easy way to feature a category from your blog.

With Featured Category Widget you can easily featured a blog category (or a category from a custom taxonomy, like products), add a custom image and optionally show the category description and a list of sub categories.

Features:

* Add custom image and set display size.
* Optionally show category description and/or subcategories.
* Supports custom taxonomies.
* Developer friendly hooks and filters throughout.
* Translated into French, Spanish, German.

== Installation ==

1. Go to Plugins > Add New and search for "Featured Category Widget".
2. Click install, then activate.
3. With the plugin activated, you'll see a new widget called "Featured Category Widget", which you can drag into your sidebar/ widget area and configure to you liking.
